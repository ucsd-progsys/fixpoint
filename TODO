wierd error from 

./fixpoint.native -notruekvars -strictsortcheck vector1.hs.fq

id 77 fails during checking, depends on:

    k_131: written in id 78, 85
    k_71 : written in id 104

iter 101, id=85 is picked and ch=true. then 131 may have changed, so why
was 77 not processed again?

because id 77 DOES NOT depend on 85:

Deps 85 = [106,105,104,103,102]
